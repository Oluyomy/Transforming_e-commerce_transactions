This is a project on an E-commerce Dataset, a UK real-world transaction data that offers valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and market dynamics, ideal for data analysts and businesses seeking to optimize their online retail strategies. 

This data was gotten from Kagglel Link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
# Project/Goals
The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked.
Questions asked:
- Are there any missing values in the dataset?
- How are the predictor variables related to the outcome variable?
- What is the correlation between the predictor variables?
- What is the distribution of each predictor variable?
- Are there any outliers in the predictor variables?
- How are the predictor variables related to each other?
- Is there any interaction effect between the predictor variables?
- What is the average age of the individuals in the dataset?
- What is the average ?
- How does the distribution of the predictor variables d

# Process
Step 1: Obtaining data

[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

Step 2: Loading and understanding the dataset.
- Working with data to understand  each predictor variables included in the dataset.
- Having a general understanding and information about the relationship between various features that contribute to the target variable (outcome).

Step 3: EDA.exploratory data analysis, 
- Create a displot, histplot, scatterplot and pairplot to look at the distributions of different predictor variables and their correlation.
- Learn the trend and detect outlier or possible factor that can affect the statistical model.
- Create heatmap to take a closer look at the corellation.

Step 4: preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Detect and handle outliers.
- Structure the data for efficient analysis.
- Split the into training and testing for appropriate training .
- Scale the data 

Step 5: Building a model.

step 6: Evaluation metrics: Appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, confusion matrix and Classification Report were included to futher evaluate our models.

step 7: Hypertuning and Cross-validation were performed to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
